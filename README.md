Factorial
=========
Write a program called Factorial1to14, to compute the factorial of n, for 1≤n≤14. Your output shall look like:
The factorial of 1 is 1
The factorial of 2 is 2
...
The factorial of 10 is 3628800


Hints: 
      Beware of overflow. Use the proper datatype to avoid numeric overflows.  
      Overflow occurs for Factorial(n+1) if (Integer.MAX_VALUE / Factorial(n)) < (n+1).
